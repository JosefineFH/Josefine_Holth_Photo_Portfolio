        <h2>Elopements / Wedding</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1000,- kr</strong> | This is a 30 minute that fits for the one
          that doesn't want that many options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2000,- kr</strong> | For the ones that want more than just the
          basic. This will be for 1 hour before or after the wedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever you go for, we will find a location that is perfect for you,
          if you have a special place or many, you might have the perfect place
          in mind, or we can find something together.
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course, this comes with a consultation hour in advance where we
          go over what you want and see for you.
          <br />
          I can also tailor packages if you want something more without this.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All these packages can also be combined, and of course, we can also
          extend them with photos during weddings or a half-day photoshoot from
          the whole day.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="center_object">
        <h2>Family portraits</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1500,- kr</strong> | We set aside one hour to take photos of
          the whole family, photos of the kids and some of just the parents. You
          can also take with you some changes of clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if you are afraid or worried that your kids will not
          collaborate with taking photos. If they want to play, walk on the
          beach, blow bubbles or bring balloons, we will do that.
        </p>
        <p>It's all up to you. This is your time.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="center_object">
        <h2>Maternity Photoshoot</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1000,- kr</strong> | This is for 1 - 2 hours at a chosen
          location. It will be passable with several outfits if you want to.
          There are images of the expectant mom and the expectant dad together
          and separately if you want to. If this is not your first pregnancy,
          there will also be images with your kids as a family.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="center_object">
        <h2>Portraits</h2>
        <p>
          This can be for engagement, anniversary or those of you who want
          photos with your loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1000,- kr</strong> | 30 minutes. This might be for the ones
          that don't need that many options.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2000,- kr</strong> | 1 hour. This is for the ones that want
          some more options. This can also be a newborn photoshoot if you want
          that. This happens when the child is 5 -14 weeks old.
        </p>

      <section class="center_object">
        <p>
          As a photographer, I am most concerned with what you want from the
          photoshoot. There are many thoughts about investing in photos, such as
          that you might feel out of place or that the children will not
          cooperate. However, there is nothing to worry about. We agree on where
          you want to take pictures, whether it is in a fantastic location or
          your own home.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I take pictures of are you as a family or you as a human being.
          So if it ends with laughter and fun, a walk on the beach, climbing
          trees, this is what I am looking for and what I want to capture in
          these pictures, laughter and love.
          <br />
          Just remember that no matter what you go for, this is an investment
          for the memories you want and remember and want to save so you can
          look back on.
